The sample consisted of 422 students with a mean age of 20.2 years (SD\\u2009=\\u20091.27). The majority of the students were female (69.7%) and Malay (81.3%). Standardized scales were used to measure the total amount of physical activity and all the study variables. The final SEM had a good fit to the data: CFI\\u2009=\\u20090.968, TLI\\u2009=\\u20090.948, SRMR\\u2009=\\u20090.036, RMSEA (90%CI)\\u2009=\\u20090.046 (0.025, 0.065), RMSEA p-value\\u2009=\\u20090.609 with 11 paths relationships. Family support had a significant effect on perceived benefits and perceived barriers. The effect of friend support on physical activity was significantly mediated by perceived benefits, self-efficacy, and psychological needs satisfaction. The effect of the availability of exercise facilities on physical activity was significantly mediated by perceived benefits and psychological needs satisfaction. Furthermore, psychological needs satisfaction mediated the effect of perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy on physical activity. The study findings illustrated that the application of the social-ecological model and psychological factors is important in order to understand and promote positive physical activity behaviour.\",\n          \"The pneumonitis associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection impacts the right ventricle (RV). However, the association between the disease severity and right ventricular systolic function needs elucidation. We conducted a retrospective study of 108 patients admitted to critical care with COVID-19 pneumonitis to examine the association between tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) by transthoracic echocardiography as a surrogate for RV systolic function with PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio as a marker of disease severity and other respiratory parameters. The median age was 59 years [51, 66], 33 (31%) were female, and 63 (58%) were mechanically ventilated. Echocardiography was performed at a median of 3 days [2, 12] following admission to critical care. The PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> and TAPSE medians were 20.5 [14.4, 32.0] and 21\\u00a0mm [18, 24]. There was a statistically significant, albeit weak, association between the increase in TAPSE and the worsening of the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio (r<sup>2</sup>\\u2009=\\u20090.041, p\\u2009=\\u20090.04). This association was more pronounced in the mechanically ventilated (r<sup>2</sup>\\u2009=\\u20090.09, p\\u2009=\\u20090.02). TAPSE did not correlate significantly with FiO<sub>2</sub>, PaO<sub>2</sub>, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, pH, respiratory rate, or mechanical ventilation. Patients with a TAPSE\\u2009\\u2265\\u200917\\u00a0mm had a considerably worse PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio than a TAPSE\\u2009<\\u200917\\u00a0mm (18.6 vs. 32.1, p\\u2009=\\u20090.005). The PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio predicted TAPSE (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.94, p\\u2009=\\u20090.004) with good area under the curve (0.72, p\\u2009=\\u20090.006). Moreover, a PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio\\u2009<\\u200926.7 (moderate pneumonitis) predicted TAPSE\\u2009>\\u200917\\u00a0mm with reasonable sensitivity (67%) and specificity (68%). In patients admitted to critical care with COVID-19 pneumonitis, TAPSE increased as the disease severity worsened early in the course of the disease, especially in the mechanically ventilated. A TAPSE within the normal range is not necessarily reassuring in early COVID-19 pneumonitis.\",\n          \"Agyrophilic grains (AGs) are age-related limbic-predominant lesions in which four-repeat tau is selectively accumulated. Because previous methodologically heterogeneous studies have demonstrated inconsistent findings on the relationship between AGs and dementia, whether AGs affect cognitive function remains unclear. To address this question, we first comprehensively evaluated the distribution and quantity of Gallyas-positive AGs and the severity of neuronal loss in the limbic, neocortical, and subcortical regions in 30 cases of pure argyrophilic grain disease (pAGD) in Braak stages I-IV and without other degenerative diseases, and 34 control cases that had only neurofibrillary tangles with Braak stages I-IV and no or minimal A\\u03b2 deposits. Then, we examined whether AGs have independent effects on neuronal loss and dementia by employing multivariate ordered logistic regression and binomial logistic regression. Of 30 pAGD cases, three were classified in diffuse form pAGD, which had evident neuronal loss not only in the limbic region but also in the neocortex and subcortical nuclei. In all 30 pAGD cases, neuronal loss developed first in the amygdala, followed by temporo-frontal cortex, hippocampal CA1, substantia nigra, and finally, the striatum and globus pallidus with the progression of Saito AG stage. In multivariate analyses of 30 pAGD and 34 control cases, the Saito AG stage affected neuronal loss in the amygdala, hippocampal CA1, temporo-frontal cortex, striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra independent of the age, Braak stage, and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE-NC) stage. In multivariate analyses of 23 pAGD and 28 control cases that lacked two or more lacunae and/or one or more large infarctions, 100 or more AGs per\\u2009\\u00d7\\u2009400 visual field in the amygdala (OR 10.02, 95% CI 1.12-89.43) and hippocampal CA1 (OR 12.22, 95% CI 1.70-87.81), and the presence of AGs in the inferior temporal cortex (OR 8.18, 95% CI 1.03-65.13) affected dementia independent of age, moderate Braak stages (III-IV), and LATE-NC. Given these findings, the high density of limbic AGs and the increase of AGs in the inferior temporal gyrus may contribute to the occurrence of dementia through neuronal loss, at least in cases in a low to moderate Braak stage.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Journal\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Acta neuropathologica communications\",\n          \"Israel journal of health policy research\",\n          \"BMC psychology\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39085962\",\n          \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39085977\",\n          \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39085955\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"PMCID\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"PMC11293082\",\n          \"PMC11293088\",\n          \"PMC11290173\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Conclusions\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The literature suggests that auditory stimulation may positively influence cortical wiring and enhance cognitive abilities.

With an increasing understanding of immunosuppressive TME, immunotherapy has become a first-line choice for advanced HCC. However, drug resistance and safety remain issues for existing immunotherapies. It is necessary to thoroughly study the specific mechanisms of complex interactions between various cells in the immunosuppressive TME. In addition, TME is a dynamically evolving environment in the context of tumor immune editing. During HCC progression, cellular composition, cytokines, extracellular matrix, and substance metabolism in TME undergo changes that significantly impact the function and anti-tumor response of immune cells. We can better regulate and enhance anti-tumor response against HCC by exploring the mechanisms underlying these changes. In conclusion, there is a need for further exploration of the complex mechanistic network in the immunosuppressive TME to provide an essential theoretical basis for the development of more effective immunotherapies in patients with HCC. |\n",

The final structural model supported eleven hypotheses with good fit indices, revealing that the psychological factors mediated the effect of the social-ecological factors on physical activity. Students with higher support from social and physical environments will have higher confidence, positive behaviour, and motivation, which could promote their physical activity participation. |\n",
